07/03/25, 11:43 pm - Me: And at last in feedback he said I should have given behave answers much better
07/03/25, 11:43 pm - Me: Amazon do care more behav than coding it happened in my case he took 30 mins for behav and 30 mins for coding 😭
07/03/25, 11:44 pm - PersonX: Arre same I read in LinkedIn some people saying this
07/03/25, 11:44 pm - PersonX: That coding went great but in feedback they Saud behaviorial
07/03/25, 11:44 pm - PersonX: Yeah ik
07/03/25, 11:44 pm - PersonX: But I seriously don't know now how to get a job
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - Me: Ya really but for many more than 70% got 15 mins 2 standard behav questions which is not my case :((
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - PersonX: And LinkedIn nobody sees messages
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - PersonX: None till now whoever I reached out
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - Me: Its a goal which is random and dont know where it is tbh :(
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - PersonX: Also like I give OAs...complete them perfectly and within time still get ghosted
07/03/25, 11:45 pm - PersonX: I don't understand what they expect more than full scores in oa
07/03/25, 11:46 pm - PersonX: But uk still I would say the number of people getting internships are really less
07/03/25, 11:46 pm - PersonX: Like the percentage
07/03/25, 11:47 pm - Me: Ya thats true luck also matters very much its not like india where we get campus placements :((
07/03/25, 11:47 pm - Me: Totally recruiter dependant
07/03/25, 11:48 pm - PersonX: Udk how much I am missing on campus placements now
07/03/25, 11:48 pm - PersonX: 😂
07/03/25, 11:48 pm - PersonX: Did you get ta or ra?
07/03/25, 11:48 pm - PersonX: At my university especially in cs even that's next to impossible
07/03/25, 11:50 pm - Me: Same here 😭
07/03/25, 11:50 pm - Me: My next plan if I dont get good FT then I would probably go back to India or choose PhD here
07/03/25, 11:51 pm - PersonX: See same plans my parents too said but I really can't do a phd
07/03/25, 11:51 pm - PersonX: No concentration left in me
07/03/25, 11:51 pm - PersonX: So maybe go back to India and find jobs there
07/03/25, 11:51 pm - PersonX: But what I am worried is such a big education loan 🫠
07/03/25, 11:52 pm - Me: You can easily get big job in India with your degree ig
07/03/25, 11:52 pm - PersonX: Are you doing a thesis ?
07/03/25, 11:52 pm - Me: we are cooked just because of that 😭😭
07/03/25, 11:52 pm - PersonX: If no internship then in summer I would probably start that
07/03/25, 11:52 pm - PersonX: At least get a paper published 🥲

07/03/25, 11:54 pm - Me: Is that real can we do PhD that fast...
07/03/25, 11:55 pm - PersonX: No😂 If in india then at least 4 years...and in the US if you are doing without an MS first 2 yrs you will just do courses more than research...so 5 yrs minimum
07/03/25, 11:55 pm - PersonX: At my university cs people take 5-6 yrs to graduate for a phd
07/03/25, 11:56 pm - Me: Ya thats what ik because my profs said this that avg duration is 5yrs
07/03/25, 11:56 pm - Me: But if I do then for sure would go into AI field tbh
07/03/25, 11:57 pm - Me: Hbu
07/03/25, 11:57 pm - PersonX: Yess...research in the US is much toygher...but courses here are too easy I feel

08/03/25, 12:05 am - Me: No Meta only gives OA to referral people
08/03/25, 12:05 am - PersonX: Maybe I am doing something gravely wrong in applications
