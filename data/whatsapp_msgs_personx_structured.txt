I am a GSoC 2020 graduate with the same.Perhaps, one of you can notify me in case there's prospect. This is strictly informal, with no association whatsoever with the institute. :D.Sugar Labs is a relatively smaller organization, but has been participating in GSoC since 2009, and will be doing so this year as well.

07/03/25 - PersonX: No😂 If in india then at least 4 years...and in the US if you are doing without an MS first 2 yrs you will just do courses more than research...so 5 yrs minimum
